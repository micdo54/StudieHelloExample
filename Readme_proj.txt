This project is based on the Hello example.
I rewrite it and make notes witch include-librarie is needed by the code.

For this example i used a Lilygo T-Display-S3, esp-idf vscode

With idf.py menuconfig i set the memeory size to 16MB and the program clock to 240MHz

For the build is used ESP-IDF V5.4.1 / ESP32S3 / JTAG FLASH
